## Dir 
```bash

## Create a repo in Mujirin account
And then clone it

git clone github.com-Mujirin:Mujirin/trying_flutter.git
```

## Git management
1. Creating a new branch and checkout to it
```bash
git checkout -b 1-first_branch
```
2. Create changes and commit it
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Adding some project info in readme.md"
git push
git push --set-upstream origin 1-first_branch
```
3. Checkout to main branch 
and pull from the last branch and push it

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin 1-first_branch
git push
```
And go to step 1
